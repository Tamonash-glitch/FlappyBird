Project Title
Flappy Bird Game

Project Description
This project is a Python implementation of the popular game "Flappy Bird." The game involves controlling a bird to navigate through a series of pipes without colliding with them. The objective is to achieve the highest score possible by successfully passing through as many pipes as possible.

The game features a bird sprite that moves up when the spacebar or the up arrow key is pressed. The bird's movement is affected by gravity, and it gradually falls down if no input is provided. Pipes are generated randomly, and the player must navigate the bird through the gaps between them. The game ends if the bird collides with a pipe or touches the bottom of the screen.
